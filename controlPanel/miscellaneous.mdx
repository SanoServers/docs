1. Login to the [SanoServers Control Panel](https://panel.sanoservers.com/)
2. Navigate to ``Account Settings`` by pressing the 3 dots next to your name on the bottom left of your screen.
3. Here, you will see four options in the sidebar. In this guide, we will discuss the two sections titled `API Credentials` and `SSH Keys,` respectively. <br/>

#### API Credentials
API Keys are a way for external systems (eg., billing systems, monitoring tools, or custom dashboards) to interact with your servers. <br/>
To add an API Key, simply head over to the tab titled ``API Credentials`` in the sidebar. <br/>
Next, just click the button titled ``Create a new API key``, this will open up a window titled ``Create a new API key``. <br/>
Now simply just enter the description of your API key into the text field titled ``Description``. This can be anything and has no direct correlation to your API key. <br/>
In the next field below, enter in the allowed IP addresses you want to be able to use your API key, this can be left blank, to allow any IP address to interact with your servers, but we recommend inputting only the IP addresses that are necessary.
