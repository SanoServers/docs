1. Login to the [SanoServers Control Panel](https://panel.sanoservers.com/)

3. Here, you will see four options in the sidebar. In this guide, we will discuss the two sections titled `API Credentials` and `SSH Keys,` respectively. <br/>

#### API Credentials
API keys allow external systems (e.g., billing systems, monitoring tools, or custom dashboards) to interact with your servers.<br/>

1. To add an API Key, simply head over to the tab titled ``API Credentials`` in the sidebar. <br/>
2. Next, just click on the button titled ``Create a new API key``, this will open up a window titled ``Create a new API key``. <br/>
3. Now simply just enter the description of your API key into the text field titled ``Description``. This can be anything and has no direct correlation to your API key. <br/>
4. In the next field below, enter in the allowed IP addresses you want to be able to use your API key, this can be left blank, to allow any IP address to interact with your servers, but we recommend inputting only the IP addresses that are necessary. <br/>
5. Now just press ``Create`` and your done!

You have now successfully added an API key to your account. <br/>

#### SSH Keys
SSH Keys allow users to access the full console of your server through an SSH client (eg. PuTTY, OpenSSH or MobaXterm).

1. To add an SSH Key, simply head over to the tab titled ``SSH Keys`` in the sidebar. <br/>
2. Next, just click on the button titled ``Create a new SSH key``, this will open up a window titled ``Create a new SSH key``. <br/>
3. Now simply just enter the description of your SSH key into the text field titled ``Description``. This can be anything and has no direct correlation to your SSH key. <br/>
4. Then enter your public SSH key into the field titled ``Public Key``, this can be retrieved in your SSH client. <br/>
5. Now just press ``Create`` and your done! <br/>

You have now successfully added an SSH key to your account. <br/>
