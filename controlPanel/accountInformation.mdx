#### Email

Your email is used for keeping track of who owns which server, meaning your servers are linked to your email. <br/>

It is currently not possible to change your email through the panel. To change your account email, please open a ticket in the [SanoServers Discord Server](https://www.discord.gg/sanoservers/). <br/>
### Update Password

You have now successfully changed your Account Password in our systems.<br/>

### 2-Factor Authentication

#### Enabling 2FA

2FA (2-Factor Authentication) is a method of securing your account even more than just a password, requiring you to enter in a 6 digit code that you get from an authenticator app, before you can access your account.

1. To enable 2-Factor Authentication, simply click the button titled ``Enable Two-Step``. <br/>
2. Now, scan the QR code using an Authenticator app (ex. Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator), or enter in the 32-digit code into an Authenticator app. <br/>
3. You will now get a 6-digit code (ex ``553990``) in your Authenticator app, enter this code into the text field below. <br/>
4. Now just enter your account password into the text field titled ``Password``, and press ``Enable``<br/>
5. You will now get a screen with 10 different backup codes. Store these in a safe place, where you won't lose them, as these codes are the only way to recover your account if you lose the 2FA method. <br/>
   
You have now successfully enabled 2FA on your account.<br/>

#### Disabling 2FA
1. To disable 2-Factor Authentication, simply click the button titled ``Disable Two-Step``. <br/>
2. Now just enter your account password into the text field titled ``Password``, and press ``Disable``. <br/>
   
You have now successfully disabled 2FA on your account.
